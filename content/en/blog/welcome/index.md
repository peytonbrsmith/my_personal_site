Special thanks to the tech behind this site: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Doks](https://getdoks.org/)!


I plan to regularly update this site with personal and school projects. You can expect to find anything from command line applications, web projects, games, and more!

I also hope to continue to post blog posts like these!
